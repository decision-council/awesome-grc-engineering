> Curated resources for GRC engineering: automation, policy as code, and continuous compliance

A curated list of tools, learning resources, frameworks, and community resources for GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) engineering — bridging traditional business-focused GRC with technical implementation.

## Policy as Code

Policy as Code transforms compliance requirements into executable code that automatically enforces organizational rules across infrastructure, applications, and cloud environments. For GRC professionals, this enables continuous compliance verification instead of point-in-time audits. For engineers, it provides guardrails that prevent misconfigurations before deployment.

### OPA (Open Policy Agent)

General-purpose policy engine using Rego language to enforce decisions across Kubernetes, Terraform, APIs, and microservices. Essential for GRC engineers building unified compliance controls across heterogeneous infrastructure — one policy language, many enforcement points.

**Why it matters:** Domain-agnostic policy framework enabling centralized control definitions that execute wherever needed — from API authorization to infrastructure provisioning.

**Best for:** Organizations needing cross-platform policy consistency across their entire stack.

**Tags:** engineer-friendly

### OPA Gatekeeper

Kubernetes admission controller built on OPA that enforces policies during resource creation and updates. Prevents non-compliant Kubernetes resources from being deployed by validating against constraint templates before admission.

**Why it matters:** Standard for Kubernetes policy enforcement with production-tested constraint framework, enabling shift-left compliance in cloud-native environments.

**Best for:** Kubernetes clusters requiring admission control and policy enforcement at the API level.

### Kyverno

Kubernetes-native policy engine that validates, mutates, generates, and cleans up resources using YAML policies — no new programming language required. For GRC engineers, Kyverno provides shift-left compliance by preventing non-compliant Kubernetes resources from deployment, with policies that map directly to security controls.

**Why it matters:** CNCF Incubating project trusted by Spotify, LinkedIn, and US DoD. Unlike general-purpose policy engines, Kyverno speaks Kubernetes natively, making it accessible to platform engineers without policy language expertise.

**Best for:** Organizations running Kubernetes workloads needing policy enforcement without Rego learning curve.

## Security Scanners

Security scanners enable shift-left compliance by identifying misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and policy violations before deployment. In GRC context, they generate automated evidence for continuous compliance and reduce audit burden by catching issues early. For engineers, they integrate into CI/CD pipelines to provide immediate feedback on security posture. Tools below are organized by workflow stage: pre-deployment scanning, unified multi-purpose scanners, and post-deployment auditing.

### Checkov

These guides help engineers translate compliance requirements into infrastructure-as-code, automated evidence pipelines, and continuous assurance architectures.

### SOC 2

SOC 2 compliance has evolved from annual point-in-time audits to continuous control monitoring with real-time dashboards. Modern SOC 2 engineering focuses on automated evidence collection, continuous assurance, and integrating compliance into existing engineering workflows rather than manual screenshot gathering.

**Engineering value:** Shift from audit prep as a painful annual event to compliance as an ongoing engineering practice. Automated control monitoring reduces audit burden while providing year-round visibility into security posture.

### NIST (OSCAL, CSF, 800-53)

NIST's Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is the machine-readable standard for compliance automation, transforming security controls from text documents into XML, JSON, and YAML formats. OSCAL enables automated validation, continuous compliance monitoring, and reduces audit preparation from months to weeks.

**Engineering value:** Convert paper-based compliance artifacts into machine-readable formats that integrate with CI/CD pipelines, security tools, and GRC platforms. Automated validation catches errors early, interoperable formats enable tool ecosystem integration, and standardized structures reduce human error in control documentation.

**Official OSCAL Resources:**

- [OSCAL Project](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) - Official NIST documentation, getting started guides, and learning materials for the Open Security Controls Assessment Language.
- [GitHub: usnistgov/OSCAL](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL) - OSCAL models, schemas, validation tools, and developer resources. Core repository for implementing OSCAL in security automation workflows.
- [GitHub: usnistgov/oscal-content](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content) - NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 security control catalog and baselines in OSCAL formats (XML/JSON/YAML). Official machine-readable versions of federal security controls.
- [CSWP 53: Charting the Course for NIST OSCAL](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/cswp/53/charting-the-course-for-nist-oscal/ipd) - NIST's strategic roadmap (December 2025) for OSCAL's future, including AI agent integration, digital twins for security modeling, and autonomous risk reasoning capabilities.

**Key OSCAL capabilities:** Machine-readable security control catalogs, automated validation and format conversion, integration with GRC platforms and security tools, community-maintained tool ecosystem.

### FedRAMP

FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) mandates OSCAL for all authorization packages by July 2026. The official FedRAMP automation repository provides pre-populated templates for System Security Plans (SSP), Security Assessment Plans (SAP), Security Assessment Reports (SAR), and Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) in machine-readable formats.

**Engineering value:** Eliminate months of manual documentation effort with pre-validated OSCAL templates. Machine-readable formats enable automated compliance checking, reduce authorization timeline, and ensure consistency with federal requirements. Templates include FedRAMP-specific extensions and conformity tags.

**Official FedRAMP OSCAL Resources:**

- [GitHub: GSA/fedramp-automation](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation) - Official FedRAMP OSCAL templates in XML, JSON, and YAML formats. Includes System Security Plans, Security Assessment Plans/Reports, and POA&M templates with FedRAMP extensions.
- [FedRAMP OSCAL Templates](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation/tree/master/src/content/rev5/templates) - Official FedRAMP OSCAL templates including System Security Plans, POA&M, SAP, and SAR in XML, JSON, and YAML formats.
